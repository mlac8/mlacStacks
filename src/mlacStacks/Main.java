 * This class will utilize the Stack class in order to manipulate an array
 * of strings. We will use the Stack to reverse the array we have hardcoded into
 * the main method.
 *
 * We will create our own Stack class as opposed to using the one provided by
 * the Java Collections Framework. Thus, we must manually create the push() method
 * to send the first element of the String array to our stack repeatedly until
 * it is full. Once the stack is full, we will implement a pop() method to send
 * the last element we just sent to the stack back to a new Array of Strings until
 * the stack is empty.
